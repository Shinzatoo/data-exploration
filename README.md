# Data Exploration: IQ, GDP per Capita, and Homicide Rates

## Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the relationships between national IQ, GDP per capita, and homicide rates across various countries. The focus is on exploring how these factors may correlate, rather than conducting a broader socioeconomic analysis of homicide rates.

## Usage Instructions

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shinzatoo/data-exploration.git
cd data-exploration
```

### Run the analysis script
```bash
python IQ-GDP-Homicide.py
```

## Results
The analysis provides insights into how national IQ and GDP per capita may be related to homicide rates, with visualizations to illustrate the findings.
